# E-commerce Website with Next.js and Node.js

This repository contains the code for an e-commerce website built with Next.js and Node.js. The website will include a frontend built with Next.js and a backend built with Node.js, and will allow users to browse products, add items to their cart, and check out securely.

## Technology Stack

The frontend of the website will be built with Next.js, a popular React-based framework for building server-side rendered web applications. Next.js provides features like automatic code splitting, static site generation, and server-side rendering, which can help improve website performance and user experience.



The backend of the website will be built with Node.js, a popular JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications. Node.js provides a non-blocking I/O model that can help improve application scalability and performance, and is well-suited for building RESTful APIs.

## Project Overview

The e-commerce website will include several pages, including a homepage, product listing page, product detail page, shopping cart page, and checkout page. The website will also include a backend API for handling product data, user authentication, and order processing.

## Important Details

- This project will use Next.js 13  and the new app model for the frontend and Node.js for the backend.
- Express.js may be used as a lightweight web framework for the Node.js backend, but this is not strictly necessary.
- The backend API will handle product data, user authentication, and order processing.
- The website will be designed to allow users to browse products, add items to their cart, and check out securely.







## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
# 
cd project-name
# 
npm run dev

to build 

`npm run build  `

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.




## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
